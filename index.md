# **Biography**

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D student in the [College of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm) from March 2018, advised by Prof. [Yihong Gong](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/ygong). Prior to that, I received the B.E. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2016. My research interests include computer vision and pattern recognition, especially in the areas of object tracking, transfer learning and multi-modal learning. [[CV]](assets/file/CV.pdf)
